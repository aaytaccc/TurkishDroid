About DevOps

We provide a place for that to happen.

DevOps is built on GitHub: open source software designed to empower communities. Because our application is open source, you can inspect every little detail of the code, 
or chip in yourself!
 GitHub is available for anyone interested in creating similar communities in any niche or passion. Visit our meta GitHub,
