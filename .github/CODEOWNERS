# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-aaytaccc and @global-aytaccakir will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @global-aaytaccc @global-aytaccakir

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-aaytaccc and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.js    @js-aaytaccc

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
